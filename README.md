# CantripAI

This is the repository for Cantrip, the final project for COMP 557 at Rice University

The preprocessing scripts can be found at src, alongside the jupyter notebook used to create Cantrip.

The finetuned model and its weights cannot be uploaded to Github as their size is too large. I can provide them upon request.
